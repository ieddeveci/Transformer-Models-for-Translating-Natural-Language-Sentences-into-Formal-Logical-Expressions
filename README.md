# NL-to-FOL Semantic Parsing Evaluation Framework

This repository contains the resources supporting the evaluation framework for neural semantic parsing from Natural Language to First-Order Logic (NL-to-FOL), as presented at the **Student Session of the 36th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI 2025)**.

## Contents

- **Datasets:** WillowNLtoFOL and WillowNLtoFOL_extended datasets for testing compositional generalization  
- **Code:** Training scripts and evaluation scripts with the metrics proposed in the article

## Purpose

The project aims to provide a systematic and automated framework for evaluating compositional generalization in semantic parsing models. This includes datasets with controlled logical complexity and metrics to analyze structural and semantic accuracy.
