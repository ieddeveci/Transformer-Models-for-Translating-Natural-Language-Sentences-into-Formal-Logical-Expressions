# Transformer Models for Translating Natural Language Sentences into Formal Logical Expressions

This repository contains the resources supporting the evaluation framework for neural semantic parsing from Natural Language to First-Order Logic (NL-to-FOL), to be presented at the **Student Session of the 36th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI 2025)**.

## Contents

- **Datasets:** WillowNLtoFOL and WillowNLtoFOL_extended datasets designed to test compositional generalization in semantic parsing  
- **Code:** Training scripts and evaluation tools implementing the metrics proposed in the article, enabling reproducible experiments

## Purpose

This project provides a systematic and automated evaluation framework for assessing compositional generalization capabilities of neural semantic parsing models. It includes datasets with controlled logical complexity and comprehensive metrics to analyze both structural correctness and semantic equivalence of model outputs.
